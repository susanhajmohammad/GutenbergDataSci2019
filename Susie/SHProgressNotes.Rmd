# Week 6

Goals:

  long term:
  
  - Find the names mentioned close to each other in each novel
  - Find the adjectives closest to certain character names
  - THis would include looking for how to code to select the nearest 5 words around a character's name for example.  
  - FIrst figure out how to split the book into lines 
  - also look into pronouns because the character's name isn't always mentioned in the text.  This could show us a difference in mood when referring to women vs. men (she/her vs he/him).  
  
  SHort term: 
  - update the metadata
     do this by manually putting in the missing gothic books into a csv an rbind it to the df I have already made.  
  - the data frame should include all the info but ultimately be split up by chapter per row.
